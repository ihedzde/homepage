My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé 📄 of Procrastination Demon 😈.

## Procrastination kinds
Type 💬 | Description 📝 | Fight 👊 strategy 
------------ | ------------- | -------------
The Anxious Procrastinator 😰 | Procrastinate a lot poorly manage their time, often taking on more work than they are capable of completing. | “Un-schedule” fill your schedule with rest 😌 and fun activities 🏄 before scheduling your work.
The Fun Procrastinator 😅 | Prefers to be doing anything else as opposed to the actual task at hand. | “Structured procrastination” by starting a different task on your to-do-list, you’ve already given less priority to that project you’ve been dreading, and yet in the meantime, you’re still being productive with your time.
The “Plenty of Time” Procrastinator ⏰ | Wait until just a few days before the deadline to begin the project. | By setting deadlines and publicly announcing them, you’re generally much more likely to complete the task, and even execute it well. Try telling your co-workers, family, and friends when setting deadlines. This form of public commitment is likely to motivate you to meet your deadlines and keep you on track.
The Perfectionist Procrastinator ✨ |  Begins procrastinating when becoming overwhelmed with the fear of producing work of a low standard, or fear of failing. | "Overcome your routine of perfection" identify each time you didn’t do ‘the perfect job’, yet the consequences were the same as if you would have.

🧙Hocus-pocus!
